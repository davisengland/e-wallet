# Getting Started with Lease End App

## Installation guidelines

## Step 1

### Install developer tools

VSCode - https://code.visualstudio.com/download  
Xcode - https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12 (for Mac users)  
Postico - https://eggerapps.at/postico/

## Step 2

### Install  necessary environments, package managers, packages, etc.

git  
node - If v16 or later, node must be downgraded (preferably v15.12.10)  
homebrew - `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`  
yarn - `brew install yarn`

## Step 3

### Add new user to Lease-End organization on GitHub

Once user is added, they will have access to repositories

Clone the Lease End app and api repositories to local machine using `git clone` followed by the url of the repository that is being cloned  
_frontend_ - `leaseend-app`  
_backend_ - `leaseend-api`

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
